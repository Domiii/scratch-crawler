## Some highlights
* [index.js](https://github.com/Domiii/scratch-crawler/blob/master/src/index.js) runs some basic experiments
* [scratchCrawlTools](https://github.com/Domiii/scratch-crawler/blob/master/src/scratchCrawlTools.js) has a few url building and page parsing functions

## Next up
1. get all kinds of stats from project websites
2. put em in a database
3. write powerful queries

Ultimate goal: get stats of specific users and/or of the entirety of the world-wide Scratch community
